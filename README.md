## ‚ú® Features

*   **‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast:** Instant QR code generation and text transfer.

*   **‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless:** No backend, no database, no sign-up required. It's just you, your devices, and the magic of the web.
*   **üì± Mobile First:** A clean, responsive, and dark-mode-friendly interface that works beautifully on phones, tablets, and desktops.
*   **üöÄ One-Click Deploy:** Deploy your own private instance to Vercel in seconds.
*   **üìñ Open Source:** Simple, clean code. Feel free to inspect, modify, and contribute.

## ü§î How It Works (The "Magic")

The secret lies in using the URL's hash (`#`) to carry the data.

1.  **Sending Device:** When you input text and click "Generate", the app:
    *   Takes your text.
    *   Encodes it using Base64 to make it URL-safe.
    *   Appends the encoded string to the current URL as a hash (e.g., `https://qr-hop.vercel.app/#SGVsbG9...`).
    *   Generates a QR code for this new, data-rich URL.

2.  **Receiving Device:** When you scan the QR code:
    *   You open the page with the data already in the URL.
    *   The app's JavaScript detects the hash, decodes it from Base64, and displays the original text.

Your data travels directly from one screen to another, never being stored or processed anywhere else.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

#### On the Sending Device (e.g., your iPhone):
1.  Open the QR-Hop website.
2.  Paste any text (URL, password, note) into the text area.
3.  Click the **"Generate QR Code"** button.
4.  A QR code will appear on the screen.

#### On the Receiving Device (e.g., your Android Tablet):
1.  Use your camera or a QR scanner app to scan the code displayed on the sending device.
2.  The QR-Hop website will automatically open with the text pre-filled.
3.  Click the **"Copy to Clipboard"** button. The text is now ready to be pasted anywhere!

## üöÄ Deploy Your Own

You can host your own version of QR-Hop for free with Vercel.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

While the transfer is direct and private, please be mindful of your environment:
*   **Shoulder Surfing:** Anyone who can see your screen can scan the QR code. Avoid using it for highly sensitive information in public places.
*   **Browser History:** The URL containing the encoded data might be saved in your browser history on the receiving device.

This tool is perfect for temporary or low-sensitivity data like URLs, one-time codes, and quick notes. For critical, long-term secrets, always use a dedicated password manager.
